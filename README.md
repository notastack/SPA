# SPA

SPA the Simple PAssword manager

To use it, just launch the script with the name of the service you wish to have a / see the password for.
It’ll either create a new password for you or output the current password.
You can delete the password by deleting .spa/service.enc

Normal version is for user friendly usage. It’ll do all the set up by itself.

Light version is for interacting with other software. It’ll still auto install all dependencies.

Light Plus version is more light but will require you to do all the setup yourself before using it. You should add [alias spall='/whereyouinstalledspa/spalightplus.sh'] to your system to make it easier to use.
